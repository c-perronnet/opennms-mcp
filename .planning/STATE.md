# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-02)

**Core value:** Claude can read, triage, and act on OpenNMS data without the user needing to know REST API syntax
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Foundation)
Plan: 1 of ? in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-03-02 — Plan 01 complete (project init + config loading)

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 5%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 3 min
- Total execution time: 0.05 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 - Foundation | 1 | 3 min | 3 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 3 min

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: TypeScript + @modelcontextprotocol/sdk — standard for MCP servers, official SDK
- [Init]: stdio transport — required for Claude CLI integration
- [Init]: Axios over native fetch — interceptors enable clean auth injection and v1/v2 routing
- [Init]: v2 API for reads, v1 for writes — FIQL available on v2; ack/clear/escalate only on v1
- [01-01]: TokenAuthSchema listed first in Zod union — prevents .strict() rejecting 'token' as unknown field on BasicAuthSchema
- [01-01]: loadConfig() uses synchronous fs.readFileSync — config must validate before MCP server instantiation for clean process.exit(1)
- [01-01]: URL trailing slash stripped in loadConfig() — prevents double-slash in API base paths at every call site

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2]: FIQL encoding edge cases for complex filters should be verified against a live OpenNMS instance during planning
- [Phase 5]: Collection config enable/disable API endpoints were not fully verified by research — flag for research step before implementation
- [Plan 01-01]: Plan file 01-01-PLAN.md is truncated at line 127 (Task 1 verify block). Research doc provided sufficient context for execution but plan should be regenerated.
